Day 3:
could try keeping a set of the coordinates of all symbols
find numbers by regexing each string and running a findAll, use the range property to calculate the adjacent coordinates
iterate over the adjacent coords to see if any appear in the symbol coord set
wouldn't have to iterate over the input twice if I store the match results in a list or something
